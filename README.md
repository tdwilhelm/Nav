# Autonomous Navigation 

> Typically we want to send the robot to a specific location and the robot should navigate autonomously to that location.
> We just need to send a good location to the robot and the navigation stack will make the robot navigate to it while avoiding obstacles.

To do this there are two types of planners. The Global Planner and Local Planner. Global Planner will determine a clear path to the target location.
The Local planner will execute the path of the Global Planner but will also handle dynamic obstacles.

Select the 2D nav goal button in RVIZ, in order to define a good location for the robot. For example I want the robot to move to this
location and you can see that the robot first plan a static obstacle free path which we call the global path planning and then executes the path using its local
path planner which also avoids dynamic obstacles.

## Built With
The ROS workspace first needs to be initialized
```javascript
mkdir ~/catkin_ws/src/
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_init_workspace
```
afterwards, the repository can be cloned or downloaded and unzipped in the corresponding path. The packages can be compiled, and the environment has to be sourced.

```
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Next, the robot is started inside the gazebo world, and the visualization program RVIZ is opened.

```
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=/home/ros/ros_map/tb3_house_map.yaml
 
```

If the Gazebo and RVIZ opened up, set location of robot by selecting 2D-Pose Estimate menu button in RVIZ. Set the the Pose Estimate by moving the cursor in RVIZ to the same location in the Gazebo map. This is necessary because RVIZ doesn't know where the robot is located. 

Then select the 2D Nav Goal menu button and select the target location for the robot.  The Global Planner and Local planner will calculate the path for the robot to follow.

## turtlebot3_Navigation-package

Within the *ball_chaser* ROS package the captured image is analyzed to determine the position of the white ball. Then it commands the robot to orientate towards the ball and drive forward. Therefore the nodes inside the *ball chaser* package need to communicate with the central robot package and subscribe to the robot camera sensor and publish to the robot's joint wheels.

### map_server Node

Inside the *ball_chaser* package the drive bot node is created, providing a service method to drive the robot around by setting its linear x and angular z velocities. The service server publishes messages containing the velocities for the wheel joints.


### RVIZ Node

The second required node inside the *ball_chaser* package is the process image node. This client node will subscribe to the robotâ€™s camera images and analyze them to determine the position of the optical colour key, a white ball. Once the ball position is determined, the client node requests a service from the drive_bot server node to drive the robot toward the ball. The robot can drive either left, right or forward, depending on the robot position inside the image.
